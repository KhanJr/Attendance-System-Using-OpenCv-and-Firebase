# Attendance-System-Using-OpenCv-and-Firebase
## Breaf Intro.
This is my innovation lab project. Using OpenCv and firebase to face recognition and take attendance.
I have create this project in my Course Lab(Innovation Lab) this is done under **```Dr Jimson Mathew (Mentor) HOD of CSE Department IIT PATNA```**.

In this project i have used **Python, Java, OpenCv, FireBase and Android studio(Create Khan Present App)** more of this i have describe in my Project file.

So let's get started,

The project started with an **Android App Name KhanPresent** this app is used to give your **Name and RollNo** on the server which i have used **FireBase**. What this does this give the total no. of student in class with there rollno.


Next get the face recognition of student to verify the student is actually present in the class.

Now we have the student present in class, what if student leave the class in the midtime so for that i have continuously running student detection that detect the upper body of student and face so can tell the number of student present in the class.

## [Project Report](https://github.com/KhanJr/Attendance-System-Using-OpenCv-and-Firebase/blob/master/Project%20Demo/projectReport.pdf)
In this report I have describe my strategies and how i planed this project to success.
I have completed this project. In next section i am going to give you a little tase of what this project is capable of.
So you can go threw my report and get some refrences from this. after you read my project report, you will be able to understand how i done this project.


## Video Demo
#### There are steps to watch these video because i have not added the code for this project(Kinda private), Please watch these accordingly.

Step I:       Read the [Project Report](https://github.com/KhanJr/Attendance-System-Using-OpenCv-and-Firebase/blob/master/Project%20Demo/projectReport.pdf) (Recommended). 

Step II:      Watch **[KhanPresentApp](https://github.com/KhanJr/Attendance-System-Using-OpenCv-and-Firebase/blob/master/Project%20Demo/KhanPresentApp.mp4)** titled video. Get that in mind this is the Android App that is used to take **RollNo and Name** to the **Server**. 

Step III:     Watch **[InnovationLab_1](https://github.com/KhanJr/Attendance-System-Using-OpenCv-and-Firebase/blob/master/Project%20Demo/InnovationLab_1.mkv)** titled video. This is the firebase output of the App input. 

Step IV:      Watch **[InnovationLab](https://github.com/KhanJr/Attendance-System-Using-OpenCv-and-Firebase/blob/master/Project%20Demo/InnovationLab.mkv)** titled video. This is the main video demo of this project. I can actually make sub-          section in this section.

Step IV(i):   First section of this Video is to find out the face recognition.

Step IV(ii):  Second sectioin of this video is to write the values in xml file using face recognition.

Step IV(ii):  Third section of this video ix to detect total number of student in the class.


## Code Of The Project
I haven't updloaded the code for this project because i am continuously devloping this project, because according to me this is one of the major need in india, we waste a ton load of paper for this purpose. I don't want our one of the key component of living (tree) to be waste like that.
